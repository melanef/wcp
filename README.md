# WCP - WebSocket CRUDL Protocol
WCP is a CRUDL implementation for WebSockets on top of Ratchet.

Have you ever felt into implementing something on WebSockets in PHP? Have your ever wanted to define a message format to transfer data and execute actions on WebSockets? 

This [article describes](https://scriv.com.br/melanef/crudl-websockets-php) why and how this was built.

WCP is almost fully framework-agnostic. It's powered by [Ratchet](https://github.com/ratchetphp/Ratchet) and is slightly opinionated by Symfony Routes, but it's totally possible to work without it.

See the Examples section for some (close to) real life usage with Laravel Command.
